# MNIST Digit Reader
## About
This is my Emerging Technologies MNIST project. For this project we had to train a neural network to recognise hand written digits from a user via a flask application.

## Project Installations
* [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

* [Keras](https://keras.io/).
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

* [Flask](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

* [Keras](https://keras.io/).
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
Project Jupyter is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages". Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda.

* [Cmder](https://cmder.net/).
Cmder is a pre-configured software package that provides you with an awesome terminal emulator, and best shell you'll ever have on Windows.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

## 4. How to Run

* Clone the repository to a folder of your choice.
* Navigate to the root folder.
* To run the application enter python app.py to the command line.
* The application will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## 4. How to Use

* Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
* Draw a number in the canvas.
* Press "Save Canvas".
* The predicted number will appear on the screen.
* To start again press "Clear Canvas" and repeat above steps.
